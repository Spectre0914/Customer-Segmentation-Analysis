Mall Customer Segmentation (K-Means)

Overview
This project segments mall customers using K-Means clustering on key features—Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score—to uncover distinct behavioral groups. The insights support targeted marketing, customer profiling, and strategic decision-making.

Dataset
Mall_Customers.csv

Columns: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score (1–100)

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

Workflow
Data Exploration: Inspect structure, summary stats, and distributions; handle missing values.

Data Visualization: Distribution, count, and scatter plots to reveal relationships.

K-Means Clustering: Use the Elbow Method to choose optimal k; cluster on selected features.

Cluster Analysis: Interpret segments by income and spending behavior; visualize clusters.

Customer Segments
Cluster 1: High income, low spending

Cluster 2: Average income, average spending

Cluster 3: High income, high spending

Cluster 4: Low income, high spending

Cluster 5: Low income, low spending

Highlights
